<h1>Collab-Hub: Getting Started</h1>

<p>Collab-Hub is a server-based networking tool for sharing control data and events between creative applications - built off Node.Js and libraries, we've written it work with Max, PD, Arduino, Web, JS libraries, and more. These modules are part of the Max client.</p>

<p>
Other clients for Collab-Hub can be found at <a href="https://www.collab-hub.io">http://www.collab-hub.io</a>.
</p>

<h2>Getting Started with Collab-Hub with Max</h2>
<p>If you've never used Collab-Hub, please use this tutorial to familiarize yourself with the modules. The following tutorials will guide you through</p>
<ul>
<li>connecting to and disconnecting from the Collab-Hub server and changing your username</li>
<li>sending and receiving data</li>
<li>observing data</li>
<li>creating and managing rooms</li>
</ul>

<techdetail><p>While following along, the <a href="https://ch-server.herokuapp.com">Collab-Hub Web Interface</a> will help you understand your interaction with Collab-Hub. The Web Interface is acting as another user/client on the server, which can do all the same things the Max modules can do: send and receive data, change username, join and leave rooms, observe to published data, and send/receive chat. </p></techdetail>
