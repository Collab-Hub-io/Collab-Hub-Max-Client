## Overview

The Collab-Hub Max Client is a tool designed to faciliate communication with the Collab-Hub server from within Cycling 74's [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max). This client will help you send/receive data over the internet between Max and/or other platforms.

The Max Client package consists of a set of modules (built as abstractions that run inside bpatchers) that can be used in different combinations depending on your needs. 

The Collab-Hub Max Client is based on [NodeForMax](https://docs.cycling74.com/nodeformax/api/) and [Socket.IO](https://socket.io).
